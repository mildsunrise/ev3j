# ev3j

This Java library allows for communication with Mindstorms EV3 robots
using their native protocol. It also allows one to assemble bytecode
for the Virtual Machine in the EV3 using a simple, chain-style API.

Zero-dependency, just download and use.

**Important:** your EV3 must have up-to-date firmware.
